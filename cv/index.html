       <p><span class="lead">I work at the interfaces between (evolutionary) community
ecology and biogegraphy, and use network analysis to adress broad questions
in these disciplines.</span></p>

<p>Graph theory offers a compact, consistent, and mathematically tractable way
to represent and analyze large and diverse ecological systems. It has been
applied widely in landscape ecology, epidemiology, and in the descriptive
analysis of mutualistic and trophic interaction networks. This approach
offers a framework that can be used for analytical or computational work,
with strong roots in linear algebra. I use networks as a representation of
species interactions, and below are some of my research directions.</p>

<h1 id="spatial-ecology-of-species-interactions">Spatial ecology of species interactions</h1>

<p>In stark contrast to decades of research on species beta-diversity, community
ecology is currently doing a very poor job of describing and understanding
the fact that species interactions vary over space and time. I focus on (i)
proving mechanistic understandings of <em>why</em> networks can vary through space and
time, and (ii) determining <em>how predictible</em> this variation is.  Ultimately,
because this will force us to understand why two populations interact,
I expect that this work will also help <em>predicting</em> species interactions.</p>

<h1 id="evolutionary-dynamics-and-phylogeny-in-networks">Evolutionary dynamics and phylogeny in networks</h1>

<p>Using mostly bipartite networks (<em>e.g.</em> plants and pollinators, hosts and
parasites), I look at how coevolutionary dynamics influence the structure
of interactions, and how much information on the history of the system
is available in its (co)phylogenetic structure. I also develop highly
phenomenological models of bipartite networks co-evolution, so as to generate
hypotheses about the macro-evolutionary dynamics of such associations.</p>

<h1 id="probabilistic-interaction-networks">Probabilistic interaction networks</h1>

<p>Predicting interactions between species will be increasingly important,
given that large-scale environmental changes will result in the emergence
of novel communities. I develop statistical approaches to integrate various
mechanisms (related to species local abundances, local trait distributions,
phylogenetic history), to derive a <em>local probability</em> that species will
interact. Doing so also requires to understand the mechanisms of species
interactions, and will give better insights on the variation of species
interactions. This also requires to re-analyze the performance of measures
of network structure under the new probabilistic framework.</p>

<h1 id="functional-relevance-of-network-structure">Functional relevance of network structure</h1>

<p><img src="/images/network-prop.png" class="left" />One of my
research goal is to understand the consequences of network structure
(and of its variability) on ecosystem properties (mostly related
to functioning), and on evolutionary dynamics. This is mostly done
through analysis and simulations of simple models, although I work
with microbial communities of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarracenia_purpurea">purple pitcher plant <em>Sarracenia
purpurea</em></a> as well. I’m
interested in the idea that the structure of network can be selected
(through ecological or evolutionary pressure) to maximize useful emerging
properties. Through collaborations, I work on similar issues on non-ecological
(social networks and cultural transmission, spatial networks and disease
spread) networks.</p>

<h1 id="open-ecology">Open ecology</h1>

<p>The paradox that ecology produces so many data, and require so many data, yet
has no proper tradition of efficient and open data sharing never ceases to
amaze me. I advocate data sharing, the use of preprints, and more broadly, the
use of the rich ecosystem of open-science applications and software in
ecological research. Although some of this advocacy resulted in publications,
this topic is mostly discussed in my blog.</p>
