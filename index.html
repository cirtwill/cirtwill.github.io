  I am a network ecologist providing analysis services through Carex Ecologics (carex.ecologics@gmail.com). I have previously worked as a postdoctoral researcher with <a href="https://www.slu.se/en/ew-cv/tomas-roslin/"> Dr. Tomas Roslin</a> 
  at the University of Helsinki, Finland, Finland, Dr. Anna Ekl&ouml;f at Link&ouml;ping, Sweden, and Dr. Peter Hamb&auml;ck at Stockholm University, Sweden. My main areas of expertise are structural analysis of plant-pollinator and predator-prey networks, with a recent focus on identifying key pollinators in smallholder crop systems and exploring the varied ways managed honeybees interact with the broader plant-insect-microbe community. I am also interested in how we can draw better conclusions from messy and missing data.

  During my PhD work with <a href="https://www.stoufferlab.org"> Dr. Daniel Stouffer </a> (University of Canterbury, New Zealand) I was introduced to network motifs, a way of describing meso-scale network structure and species’ roles in networks. I used motifs to explore differences in the ways that parasites and free-living species interact in food webs, and expanded motif theory to describe the roles of interactions as well as species. After my PhD I completed postdoctoral work with <a href="https://liu.se/en/employee/annek49"> Dr. Anna Eklöf </a> (Linköping University, Sweden) and <a href="https://www.su.se/profiles/phamb-1.192363"> Dr. Peter Hambäck </a> (Stockholm University, Sweden). This work included linking species’ motif roles to traits such as body mass and habitat use, developing a simple Bayesian framework to supplement observed interaction data with prior knowledge, and applying this framework to networks based on spider gut contents.
