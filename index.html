  <p> I am a postdoctoral researcher currently working with
  <a href="https://www.su.se/profiles/phamb-1.192363"> Dr. Tomas Roslin</a> 
  at the University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland. I am investigating how 
  phenological change in plants and insects affects pollination networks, 
  including crops that we humans depend on. I am also interested in how we can 
  draw better conclusions from messy  and missing data. </p>


  <p> I recently left the lab group of
  <a href="https://www.su.se/profiles/phamb-1.192363"> Dr. Peter Hamb&auml;ck</a> at
    Stockholm University, Stockholm, Sweden. In ongoing collaborations, we 
    are using spider-based food webs to investigate effects of marine 
    subsidies on terrestrial communities and the potential for spiders to provide biological control of orchard pests.</p>


  <p> I am also collaborating with 
      <a href="https://www.ifm.liu.se/theomod/theobio/staff/anna-eklof-1/index.xml">Dr. Anna
          Ekl&ouml;f</a> at Link&ouml;ping University, Link&ouml;ping,
      Sweden. Our previous research used species' roles in food webs to
      better understand how species traits relate to network
      structure, how species' structural roles relate to their
      contributions to ecosystem services, and similar questions. We are currently exploring how motif-based analyses might complement other measures of network structure. </p>
      
   <p> I completed my PhD in 2016, working with 
  <a href="http://www.stoufferlab.org">Dr. Daniel Stouffer</a> 
  at the University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand.
  My thesis research dealt with food webs and other ecological
  networks, and answering questions like "Do parasites have
  different effects on community structure than free-living
  species?", "Can we predict extinction risk based on local
  food webs?", and "Does food web structure change over 
  latitudinal gradients?".  I completed my BSc working with 
  <a href="http://ecocomplexity.blogspot.co.nz">Dr. Tamara Romanuk </a> in 2012. </p>
