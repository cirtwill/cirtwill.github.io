  <p> My main area of interest is food webs and other ecological networks. 
  As maps of different kinds of interactions between species, these networks 
  provide an excellent framework with which to understand communities. In 
  addition to working with communities as a whole, a network framework also 
  allows us to investigate the ways in which particular species fit into their communities. 
  In other words, with ecological networks we can look at the forest and the trees. </p>


  <p> I am particularly interested in fine-scale approaches that link the traits of 
  species (or even interactions between species) with their roles in networks. In the 
  past I have compared parasites to free-living species, and I’m currently looking at 
  phylogenetic conservation of plants' pollinators and whether different groups of insect 
  pollinators respond differently to changing climate. My future plans include expanding 
  this approach to look at the roles of invasive species in their home and introduced ranges, 
  how species’ roles change seasonally and across years, and how the roles of individuals within 
  a species vary.</p>
