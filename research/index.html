  <p> My main area of interest is food webs and other ecological networks. 
  As maps of different kinds of interactions between species, these networks 
  provide an excellent framework with which to understand communities. In 
  addition to working with communities as a whole, a network framework also 
  allows us to investigate the ways in which particular species fit into their communities. 
  In other words, with ecological networks we can look at the forest and the trees. </p>


  <p> I am particularly interested in fine-scale approaches that link the traits of 
  species (or even interactions between species) with their roles in networks. In the 
  past I have compared parasites to free-living species, tested the influence of 
predators and prey on island biogeography, and examined latitudinal gradients in network structure. For current research projects, click the links below. </p>
