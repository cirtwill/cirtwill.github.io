  <p> My main area of interest is food webs and other ecological networks. 
  As maps of different kinds of interactions between species, these networks 
  provide an excellent framework with which to understand communities. In 
  addition to working with communities as a whole, a network framework also 
  allows us to investigate the ways in which particular species fit into their communities. 
  In other words, with ecological networks we can look at the forest and the trees. </p>


  <p> I am particularly interested in fine-scale approaches that link the traits of 
  species (or even interactions between species) with their roles in networks. In the 
  past I have compared parasites to free-living species, tested the influence of 
predators and prey on island biogeography, and examined latitudinal gradients in network structure. For current research projects, click the links below. </p>

      The Baltic Sea is ecologically and economically important to all of the countries that border it. The human uses for the Baltic impose a number of different pressures that threaten other species, the communities they make up, and the services we provide. I am involved in several projects aiming to better understand the structure of the Baltic food web. Research questions under this umbrella include how the Baltic food web varies spatially and with respect to environmental variables, and how the food web will mediate the effects of different threats on ecosystem services.
