<b> Concomitant predation on parasites is highly variable but constrains the ways in which parasites contribute to food web structure. </b> <br>
Summary: <br>
1. Previous analyses of empirical food webs (the networks of who eats whom in a community)
have revealed that parasites exert a strong influence over observed food web structure
and alter many network properties such as connectance and degree distributions. It remains
unclear, however, whether these community-level effects are fully explained by differences in
the ways that parasites and free-living species interact within a food web. <br>
2. To rigorously quantify the interrelationship between food web structure, the types of species
in a web and the distinct types of feeding links between them, we introduce a shared
methodology to quantify the structural roles of both species and feeding links. Roles are
quantified based on the frequencies with which a species (or link) appears in different food
web motifs – the building blocks of networks. <br>
3. We hypothesized that different types of species (e.g. top predators, basal resources, parasites)
and different types of links between species (e.g. classic predation, parasitism, concomitant
predation on parasites along with their hosts) will show characteristic differences in their
food web roles.  <br>
4. We found that parasites do indeed have unique structural roles in food webs. Moreover,
we demonstrate that different types of feeding links (e.g. parasitism, predation or concomitant
predation) are distributed differently in a food web context. More than any other interaction
type, concomitant predation appears to constrain the roles of parasites. In contrast, concomitant
predation links themselves have more variable roles than any other type of interaction. <br>
5. Together, our results provide a novel perspective on how both species and feeding link
composition shape the structure of an ecological community and vice versa. <br>

<b> How exotic plants integrate into pollination networks. </b> <br>
Summary: <br>
1. There is increasing world-wide concern about the impact of the introduction of exotic species on
ecological communities. Since many exotic plants depend on native pollinators to successfully establish,
it is of paramount importance that we understand precisely how exotic species integrate into
existing plant–pollinator communities. <br>
2. In this manuscript, we have studied a global data base of empirical pollination networks to determine
whether community, network, species or interaction characteristics can help identify invaded
communities. <br>
3. We found that a limited number of community and network properties showed significant differences
across the empirical data sets – namely networks with exotic plants present are characterized
by greater total, plant and pollinator richness, as well as higher values of relative nestedness. <br>
4. We also observed significant differences in terms of the pollinators that interact with the exotic
plants. In particular, we found that specialist pollinators that are also weak contributors to community
nestedness are far more likely to interact with exotic plants than would be expected by chance alone. <br>
5. Synthesis. By virtue of their interactions, it appears that exotic plants may provide a key service
to a community’s specialist pollinators as well as fill otherwise vacant ‘coevolutionary niches’. <br>
